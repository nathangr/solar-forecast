Integration research project

## Pre-requisites
* Python 3.8
* GNU awk
* grep
* make
* graphviz (macOS) or dot (Win)
* The following Python libraries:
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * seaborn

## Getting data
Get all data files found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/ams-2014-solar-energy-prediction-contest/data and save to a location of your choice on your computer. You may have to create a user account at kaggle.com first.

Once you have unpacked the data files:

* copy "train.csv" to the "stations" directory
* create a "ncdf_data" directory in your local project directory
* copy all files from the gefs_train.zip archive that end with "latlon_subset_19940101_20071231.nc" to the "ncdf_data" directory

## Running the experiment
Simply type in a terminal:

```
make all
```

## Viewing results
Once the make command has finished executing, results can be found under the "results" directory. A text file contains a capture of the console output generated by the various steps of the make command. A directory named "train_set_complete1_100" contains various charts.
